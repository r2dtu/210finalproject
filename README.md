# Recommender Systems in Data Mining
### Course: DSC 210: Numerical Linear Algebra
Instructor: Dr. Tsui-wei Weng
Group: Xujun Lian, David Tu, Albert Zhong

## Instructions
Ensure that the following libraries are installed in python 3 environment:
- surprise (the notebook will do this for you, if not)
- pandas
- numpy
- fastai

Open `mf_ncf_collaborative_filtering.ipynb` and run all the cells of the notebook.

## Results
You will get lots of different results based on the different hyperparameters set for each of the models. Below is a chart of our findings of the most optimal algorithms, that is, the errors that are the least over/underfitted and lowest for a given technique.
